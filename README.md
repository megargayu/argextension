# JDA Utilities Argument Extension
### A simple extension that adds argument capabilities to [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities)

When you get an event and run `getArgs()` in a command, you will get a string. Now, this is great and all, but I thought - why don't we make a simple `ArgumentCommand` class which will automatically parse arguments for you? This is the result of that thought.
